What is your plan to market our project, while we're building it?


What do you think about my blog posts? Will you use it? Will they help in your work or not.

I have a lot experience in food tech and i can share this experience.

While we building project and you cannot show our project to future users => what moves do you want to do?
What do you need from me?

How much time it can take from launch to $100 income? what

How do you think we should charge our users? is it recurring subscription or just pay for "spots" in our database(save 10 lists for $10 and next 10 for $5)?
What if time that you assumed - will be wrong? i don't mean instead of one month it takes two.
From my side both results are good. But what if instead of one month it will take 5? are you ready for this case?

i've made a lot of preparations for marketing and one of the points are creating a "startup profiles"
at different websites. I have a long list - maybe we should think about filling that forms...
Maybe by creating more buzz about us - we'll be able to find some investor, that will give us "quick money"...
Is it possible? Please tell me what do you think.

I think we can make it work with my tech experience and your marketing skill more quickly.
But you'll need to communicate with outside world - because right now i want to focus on coding

I have a separated document, where i explain my plans to my developers, i think it worth sharing with you.
it'll help you to understand me better.

How you exactly figure out that this project is worth your time?
I think for the first view it looks sad and un-finished :)
i think it's hard for most people that i talk with to understand what, how and why i'm building it.
