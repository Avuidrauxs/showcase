Showcase is a project where we trying to incorporate two major tasks:
1. show to a new users a collection of grocery lists - before they sign up - they want to explore the data that we have
2. figure out the way about making GL downloable by generating a simple PDF file

While we're coding it - we also extending the code base of GS, by testing fetch plugin, by moving away basic components, like lists, grocerylist component, etc...


- [ ] install and connect Raven at index.js
- [ ] adjust logic of envconfig and try to connect to our local/shared servers
- [ ] make first axios calls and be happy to receive json results
